# Linear constrained optimization for HBP* design

This repository contains the script which uses intervention-level data on cost-effectiveness, size of eligible population consuambles cost, human resource requirements 
to generate an optimal health benefits package for a country, which maximises the population health impact given the chosen constraints. 

This model was first applied to Uganda in 2020.
